## Functions used to work winnerlist_controller

# From storage, readerevents will take each line in (prefferably times.txt)
# and store the entire string as an array inside a different array
# ex. "EventA, Time1, ID1, Time2, ID2, ..." is turned into
# [[EventA, Time1, ID1, Time2, ID2, ...],[EventB ...]]
# With this different array, the event title is extracted and put into 
# a final array.
#
# This final array is returned as [EventA, EventB,...]

# Takes a flatstorage file (entrants.txt) and retrieves ID and name info
# 
# Returns single name corresponding to ID
